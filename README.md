# Fifty Shades of Legacy Goose Game

Here you'll fine some legacy implementations of the [Goose Game kata](https://github.com/xpeppers/goose-game-kata).

We built a "refactor legacy code" kata around [this particular](https://github.com/xpepper/fifty-shades-of-legacy-goose-game/blob/master/goose-game-two/) implementation. [Its README](https://github.com/xpepper/fifty-shades-of-legacy-goose-game/blob/master/goose-game-two/README.md) describes the kata, so go there to start practicing.

PS. The other implementations are there to give you more challenges in refactoring legacy code.
